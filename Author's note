<p>
A Mom always wishes her children to be as independent as they can be. 
At the same time they want their children to reach out to them for recipes, traditional querries or anything under the earth. 
It is really important for moms to incorporate many practices when their children are young.
They learn a lot by observing, and hands on experience. Parents are their first role model. 
Mom is the person to go for anything and everything and she never gets tired of supporting her child. 
This is like a diary I would like to pass on to my girls when they cannot reach me.
